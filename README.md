# Bat ANN

A Neural Network optimized using the Bat Optimization Algorithm

## How to run the code
- run `g++ make.cpp -o make.exe`
- run `make.exe`
- run `bat-ann.exe`

In case files are added, adjust the system command in make.cpp and run the above commands again

## Results
- The best result will be printed on screen with its Iteration count, the best bat's solution and its fitness
- Plots will be created in the /plots/ folder
- [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is required to view the created plots
